# Linux Install
Install ogr2ogr, osmium, postgresql, postgis, ogr2osm from github(install in /opt)
Setup postgresql database and enable postgis
Change details in pg2osm and load_csv to reflect database details
Change oa_root and root to correct paths

# Data Processing
Add to sql statements to --sql flag in ogr2osm calls or add code after load finished for complex processing

# Limitations
Setup for US states only
Running many states with update-osm will probably result in geofabrick rate limiting
ogr2osm xml writer will choke on unicode stops
